## ✨ Features

### 🏗️ 5 Well Structures
- **Forgotten Well** — A weathered wooden structure found near water

- **Clear Well** — A pristine white structure with clean architecture
- **Sunken Well** — Partially submerged underwater
- Wells generate naturally throughout the world with 300+ blocks spacing
- Each well has an above-ground section connected to an underground chamber

### 🔮 3 Collectible Totems
Each well chest contains one random totem:
- **Soaked Totem** — A waterlogged artifact
- **Clear Totem** — A crystal-clear relic
- **Deep Totem** — An artifact from the depths

### 🏆 Advancements
- **Water Seeps In** — Obtain a Soaked Totem
- **Clarity Settles** — Obtain a Clear Totem
- **Depths Endured** — Obtain a Deep Totem
- **At Home in Water** — Collect all three totems

### 💧 Permanent Water-Healing Buffs
Each advancement grants **"Blessing of the Waterways"** buffs:

**Lingering (Levels I–III)**:
- Heals when standing in water after an activation delay
- Higher levels reduce healing interval (3s → 2.5s → 2s)
- Heals 0.5 hearts per interval
- Automatically levels up as you collect different totems

**Attunement**:
- Granted upon collecting all three totems
- Reduces activation delay from 5 seconds to 2 seconds
- Stacks with Lingering for faster, more responsive healing

All buffs are **permanent** and **persist through death**.
